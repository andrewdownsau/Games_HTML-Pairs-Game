Welcome to my pairs game. This project was started as simple means of exploring how to use html, css and javascript. <br><br>
My design parameters are to generate a card system of 5*10 cards that all must be matched with it's distinct pair. <br><br>
The game records how many turns and how many seconds it takes to get all of the pairs. <br><br>
I'm also using this as my first git-hub profile project to show others what I can do and how I code. <br><br>
The best way to play the game is to copy this repository to your local memory then load the html file in the root directory (/HTML_Pairs_Game.html)
