Welcome to my pairs game

This project was started as simple means of exploring how to use html, css and javascript.

My design parameters are to generate a card system of 5*10 cards that all must be matched with it's distinct pair. The game records how many turns and how many seconds it takes to get all of the pairs.

I'm also using this as my first git-hub profile project to show others what I can do and how I code.
